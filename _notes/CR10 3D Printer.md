### Why I 3D print outside
I've had a CR10 3D printer for around four years now, one black Friday I scored a CR10 with modifications that brought it closer to a CR10s. When I first started printing I set everything up in my bedroom with the window open however even with the proper configuration I'd notice a smell of plastic that would only show up near  the end of a long printing session. More days of printing I noticed that the family cat was no longer coming near my room I could only assume that the smell coming off of the 3D printer was a lot stronger to the cat than it was to me. After this I decided to build  an enclosure for the CR10 and move it outside when I wanted to print and inside for the winter much like the house plants.
