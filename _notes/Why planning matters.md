#### When upgrades go sideways

Maybe you've been there maybe you haven't. A Client has an emergency upgrade they need done either due to a CVE that has come out or a requirement from their [[infrastructure]] with this rushed requirement we may miss the elephant in the room; checking compatibility across all infrastructure. Something we often take for granted and possibly overlook are version requirements software shares with its hypervisor. For example most software shares a version requirement with its hypervisor, what happens when you patch the hypervisor past a supported version in the matrix? 

**Do you downgrade?** 
The short answer is no, we don't want to rebuild something that could be avoided with planning. Having details of your projects with a way to process the data sets you up for success. I've recently switched to Obsidian for my note taking which has changed the way I look at my data ingress and egress. In the past I've used One Note, Notepad++ along with other solutions to store notes on-the-fly, but I was never able to organize all of the data in one easy place to conceptualize until now. Along with my new found love for Obsidian I've decided to register this domain to plan for the future. 

#### Plan for the future be in the now
Something I need to get better at is planning for whats next but also staying cemented in whats going on around me now. There are days I will get caught up in whats happening at the end of my week rather than enjoying the time that's moving by now. It manifest a bit of anxiety to be so focused on the unknown. Keeping myself grounded through projects like this help me not only stay focused in my current work but better plan for the future.
